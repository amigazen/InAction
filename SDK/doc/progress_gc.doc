   TAGS
        PROG_MaxVal (ULONG) - Sets/Gets maximum available value.
                Default for this tag is 100. Applicability is (ISG).

        PROG_CurVal (ULONG) - Sets/Gets current value.
                Default for this tag is 0. Applicability is (ISGNU).

        PROG_TextFont (struct TextFont *) - Sets/Gets font used for
                text rendering. Default for this tag is current font.
                Applicability is (IG).

        PROG_ConvertToPercents (BOOL) - If set to true all values
                rendered in gadget will be converted to percents.
                Default for this tag is TRUE. Applicability is (ISG).
